Web Scraping Project with Python – Extracting Laptop Data 🖥️📊

I recently completed a Python project where I scraped laptop details from a sample e-commerce website using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas. 📈

📌 Project Overview:
I developed a Python script to extract product information (Title, Price, and Description) from the first 10 pages of an e-commerce site and export it into an Excel file for analysis.

📌 Tools Used:

requests for sending HTTP requests
BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content
pandas for data manipulation and exporting to Excel
📌 Key Features:
✅ Scrapes multiple pages (first 10 pages)
✅ Extracts essential details: Title, Price, and Description
✅ Exports data to an Excel file (laptops.xlsx)

📌 Use Cases:

Data Analysis: Analyzing product trends and pricing.
Competitive Research: Comparing laptop prices and features across competitors.
Automation: Automating repetitive data extraction tasks.
